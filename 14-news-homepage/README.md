## My process

I built the desktop version first and then change Grid settings when dealing with media queries. Not sure if I can also use mobile first work-flow with this challenge, because having the final grid layout done first is easier.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
